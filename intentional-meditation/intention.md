<h1>Intention</h1>
<p class="lead">One of the most important aspects of starting a meditation practice is being clear about why you are doing it.</p>

<h4>Release or Connection?</h4>

<p>You might be starting meditation because you want to become calmer, or even to be released from the difficulties of the world.  You might be starting meditation because you want to feel more deeply connected with and engaged in life.  You might say: both! These two different intentions are not necessarily contradictory, but they can become contradictory if you are not aware what is most important to you, and if you are not aware of the intended outcomes of the meditation practices you are using.</p>

<h4>Release</h4>
<p>Some meditation practices are intended to reduce to an absolute minium your engagement with most human activity.  They are designed for a monastic life, and you could argue that they are ultimately intended to free you from entanglement with life altogether: the state known variously as <b>Cessation</b> or Nirvana.</p>

<h4>Connection</h4>
<p>Some mediation practices are intended to allow you to engage more fully as a human.  They are designed for a life led in the beating heart of things, in the deep mess of human entanglement: <b>Skillful Activity in the World</b>.<p>
<p>Your intentions may shift over time.  You may need to withdraw from life for a period of time, or withdraw from certain activities, and certain Release practices may be very helpful in allowing you to do that skillfully.  But it is important to be conscious of those intentions, and therefore to be fully aware which practices will help you.
