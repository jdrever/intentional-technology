## Simple
<ul>
    <li>This could be achieved with a paper-based note book.</li>
    <li>As ever, the easiest digital solution to implement will be to use a note-taking tool integrated with your email system.
        <ul>
            <li>For Microsoft, that would be <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/onenote-getting-started-020b2cd0-2e7e-4918-8e58-f434953acca2" target="_blank">OneNote</a></li>
            <li>For Google, that would be <a href="https://support.google.com/keep/answer/2888240?hl=en-GB&amp;ref_topic=6262468" target="_blank">Keep</a></li>
            <li>For Apple, that would be <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/notes/welcome/mac" target="_blank">Apple Notes</a></li>
        </ul>

</ul>
## Intermediate
If you have a number of tasks to keep track of, you may need a separate tasks application. If you only need to manage tasks in a relatively simple way (for example, not need to share or delegate tasks, or put tasks into projects) you can use the task application that comes as part of your office suite.

* If you use Microsoft365 for email, you can use {%link "https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/microsoft-to-do-list-app?rtc=1" %}Microsoft ToDo {%endlink%} for simple tasks. You also have the option of Microsoft Planner for tasks that are part of wider projects.
* If you use Google Workspace, you have access to {%link "https://support.google.com/tasks/answer/7675772?hl=en-GB&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop" %}[Google Tasks]){%endlink%}.
* If you use Apple products, you have the {%link "https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/reminders/remndc729e28/mac" %} Reminders {%endlink%} app.

## Complex
If you have different projects to keep track of, or if you need to collaborate with others on your tasks, you might need a dedicated application outside of your office suite.   This requires more effort, so only do it if you have to!

There are many, many different options for task management available, but two well known examples are Trello and Todoist: which are cloud-based and works well across Windows and Mac and Android. Both are free for low levels of usage but start charging as you need more complexity.
