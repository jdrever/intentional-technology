{% idea "Keep it simple" %}
You want to find the simplest solution you can live with.  

Below we have provided ways of making your eco-system of tools that are <strong>Simple</strong>, <strong>Intermediate</strong> and <strong>Complex</strong>.

There is nothing big or clever about complex solutions to simple problems - start simple, and only add complexity in response to a genuine need.  A list of tasks on a scrap of paper on your desk may be exactly what you need, at least as a starting point.
