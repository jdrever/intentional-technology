Tana is a new note-taking app which looks very interesting.

It seems to take the most compelling bits of Roam and Notion.

- It has the open-ended, journal-like feel of Roam, with the ability to create two-way links
- It also has the knowledge graph/[outliner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner) structure of Roam, so that each line of content is a node in its own right
- It also has the database-like feel of Notion, but applied at the level of individual lines of content.  You can create a proper schema for each node, which is a step beyond what you can do in Roam.
- Plus it has the concept of inheritance from object-oriented programming

It looks like it would be a really nice way to build a CRM system which could also handle projects and tasks.

At the moment Tana is in an Early Access phase.  You can find out more at [https://tana.inc/](https://tana.inc/).

There is also a series of YouTube videos about using Tana at [https://youtu.be/WqASI-p-dJM](https://youtu.be/WqASI-p-dJM)
