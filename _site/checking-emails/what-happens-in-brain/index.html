<h2 class="text-dark display-6"><strong><i class="bi bi-lightbulb-fill"></i>&nbsp;KEY IDEA:&nbsp;</strong></span>What happens to your brain when you check your emails?</strong></h2>
<p>If checking your emails makes you anxious, there is strong brain activity in the amygdala, which processes emotions and fear, and in the hippocampus, which makes memories out of your experiences.</p>
<p>The amygdala then releases hormones, notably adrenaline, which prime your body for a &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; reaction. Normally the effects of the adrenaline will subside over time but if the anxiety is habitual then decision-making (performed by the pre-frontal cortex, can become primarily emotional rather than rational, and the hippocampus can shrink, leading to forgetfulnness.</p>
