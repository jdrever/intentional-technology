    <p>The first real life situation we are going to look at is checking your emails.</p>
    <p>The next time you check your emails, try to do it without thinking too much about doing it differently.
        &nbsp;We just want to explore how your current way of doing things works, and how it feels. &nbsp;Once
        you're done, complete the Feedback exercise below. &nbsp;Try not to peek at the questions until you've
        completed checking your emails.</p>
