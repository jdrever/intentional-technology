{% idea "What happens to your brain when you check your emails?" %}

If checking your emails makes you anxious, there is strong brain activity in the amygdala, which processes emotions and fear, and in the hippocampus, which makes memories out of your experiences.

The amygdala then releases hormones, notably adrenaline, which prime your body for a "fight-or-flight" reaction. Normally the effects of the adrenaline will subside over time but if the anxiety is habitual then decision-making (performed by the pre-frontal cortex, can become primarily emotional rather than rational, and the hippocampus can shrink, leading to forgetfulnness.
