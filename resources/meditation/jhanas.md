<h1>Focussed Awareness on Pleasure in the Body: <i>The Jhanas</i></h1>

<p>The jhanas are a series of deepening states of meditative absorption.   They start by noticing and then amplifying the sensations of pleasure and joy in the body.  In that sense, they start with the Focussed Awareness/shamatha technique of focusing on an object and then adds in an additonal step (which is switching from focusing on the object to focusing on the pleasure and joy that arises in the body).</p>

<p>Michael Taft explains the process of entering the first jhana in this video.</p>

    <tr>
        <th>First jhana: PLEASURE-JOY</th>
        <td>Focus on pleasure in the body (<i>piti</i>), with joy (<i>sukha</i>) in the background</td>

        <th>Second jhana: JOY-PLEASURE</th>
        <td>Focus on joy in the body, with pleasure in the background</td>

    <tr>
        <th>Third jhana: JOY</th>
        <td>The afterglow of joy in the body</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Fourth jhana: BEYOND JOY</th>
        <td>Quiet stillness</td>

<p>Brassington speculates on the relationship between neurotransmitters and the different points of focus in the jhanas: pleasure in the body may be connected to dopamine breaking down into norepinephrine, and the feeling of joy may be connected to endorphins.</p>
