{% idea "What can happen in the brain as we check our emails?" %}

<p class="lead">The “fight-or-flight” response evolved to prime the heart, muscles and lungs of animals to allow them to survive dangers such as hungry predators, or to see off rivals. After the immediate threat has passed, a “relaxation” or “rest and digest” response kicks in to restore the body to a state of calm.</p>

But in humans, technologies such as social media and email can keep the fight-or-flight response constantly switched on by continually presenting us with stimuli that provoke feelings of fear or aggression.

If checking your emails makes you feel anxious or hostile, there will be strong, sustained activity in a brain structure called the amygdala, which processes emotions such as fear and anger. The amygdala operates like a smoke alarm, emitting an alarm signal in response to signs of danger in the environment. 

Unlike a smoke alarm, however, the amygdala and a neighbouring brain region called the hippocampus — which encodes and stores memories — can learn from past experience. Between them these parts of the brain learn to associate particular stimuli with unpleasant or painful outcomes.

This means that these “conditioned stimuli” will provoke an aggressive or fearful response from the body even if nothing bad actually happens. In the context of emails, this means that simply seeing a particular word or phrase in the subject line, or the source of the message, can trigger strong feelings of fear or hostility.

When the amygdala registers a perceived threat in our environment, it sends a distress signal to a gland in the brain called the hypothalamus. This forwards the message to the rest of the body, including the adrenal glands, which are triangular structures on top of the kidneys. 

The message is sent lightning-fast via the sympathetic nervous system, which is the branch of the involuntary (or “autonomic”) nervous system that primes the body for vigorous action. Within a fraction of a second, this electrical signal activates the fight-or-flight response.  

The adrenal glands respond by releasing the molecules adrenaline and noradrenaline (also known as epinephrine and norepinephrine, respectively) into the bloodstream. As adrenaline circulates around the body, it brings on a number of physiological changes needed for physical exertion, including increased heart rate, breathing rate and blood pressure. It also diverts blood flow from the digestive system to the muscles and increases blood sugar levels.

In the brain, noradrenaline acts as a neurotransmitter or molecular nerve signal to increase our state of arousal and alertness. This enhances attention and memory formation, but it also promotes feelings of restlessness and anxiety. 

As the initial surge of adrenaline subsides, the pituitary gland and hypothalamus sustain the stress response by signalling to the adrenal glands to release a hormone called cortisol. This is a form of steroid that influences the immune, digestive and reproductive systems. Adrenaline and cortisol also affect our mood. 

In nature, the flight-or-flight response helps to ensure that an animal lives to fight another day. The unique problem that we humans have is our ability to reflect on the past and future, made possible by our highly developed prefrontal cortex (PFC) at the front of each hemisphere of the brain.  

If this self-reflection involves rumination and worry, it can sustain the activation of our sympathetic nervous system even in the absence of fear or anger-provoking stimuli. Self reflection is mediated by a constellation of brain regions in the PFC known as the default mode network.

The effects of this kind of chronic (sustained or long-term) stress are widespread. They include anxiety, depression, problems with memory and concentration, muscle tension and pain, weight gain and trouble sleeping. Years of chronic stress are linked to high blood pressure, strokes and heart attacks.

Acute (short-term) stress can increase our state of alertness and promote learning, but chronic stress may impair memory and even shrink the hippocampus.
And while acute stress primes the immune system, chronic stress suppresses it.

So our recently evolved, highly developed PFC is a mixed blessing. It provides “top-down” regulation of thought, action and emotion, allowing us to adapt and function effectively in our increasingly information-driven, interconnected society. 

But the ability to reflect on unpleasant events in the past and future can also keep our stress response switched on. In turn, these chronic levels of stress can impair the PFC’s ability to moderate our habitual responses of fear and aggression (triggered by the amygdala) to conditioned stimuli. It’s a vicious circle!
