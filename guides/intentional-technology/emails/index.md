<h1>Checking Your Emails</h1>

{% idea "We are looking at using technology in an every day way" %}
  <p class="lead">We'll be looking at how we check emails and browse the web to gather information. &nbsp;We won't be doing
      anything fancy. &nbsp;We will just be exploring some small changes to the way we approach some everyday tasks.
  </p>
{% endidea %}

{% activity "Checking Your Emails" %}
  <p class="lead">The first real life situation we are going to look at is checking your emails.</p>
  <p>The next time you check your emails, try to do it without thinking too much about doing it differently.
      &nbsp;We just want to explore how your current way of doing things works, and how it feels. &nbsp;Once
      you're done, complete the Feedback exercise below. &nbsp;Try not to peek at the questions until you've
      completed checking your emails.</p>
