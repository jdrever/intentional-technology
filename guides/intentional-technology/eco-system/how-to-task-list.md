{% guidance "How can I set up a Task List?" %}
## Simple
* The simplest way of implementing this is just a paper notepad.
* The easiest digital solution will be to use a location within your email system.
  * If you are using Microsoft 365 or Outlook for email, you can create a Tasks folder under your Inbox.  {% link "https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/organize-email-by-using-folders-0616c259-4bc1-4f35-807d-61eb59ac79c1" %}There is a Microsoft video and documentation on doing this. {% endlink %}
  * If you are using Gmail, you can set up a Task label.  {% link "https://support.google.com/mail/answer/118708?hl=en-GB&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop" %}There is a a Google video on documentation on doing this]{% endlink %}.
* Once you have your folder or label set up, you can move the email into it.  
* Create a Done folder/label in the same way, and then once you have completed the task associated with the email, move the email in that Done folder/label.
* This will work fine if you get most of your tasks via email, if it is clear from the email what action you need to take, and if don't need to keep track of them in a separate application.

## Intermediate
If you have a number of tasks to keep track of, you may need a separate tasks application. If you only need to manage tasks in a relatively simple way (for example, not need to share or delegate tasks, or put tasks into projects) you can use the task application that comes as part of your office suite.

* If you use Microsoft365 for email, you can use {%link "https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/microsoft-to-do-list-app?rtc=1" %}Microsoft ToDo {%endlink%} for simple tasks. You also have the option of Microsoft Planner for tasks that are part of wider projects.
* If you use Google Workspace, you have access to {%link "https://support.google.com/tasks/answer/7675772?hl=en-GB&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop" %}[Google Tasks]){%endlink%}.
* If you use Apple products, you have the {%link "https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/reminders/remndc729e28/mac" %} Reminders {%endlink%} app.

## Complex
If you have different projects to keep track of, or if you need to collaborate with others on your tasks, you might need a dedicated application outside of your office suite.   This requires more effort, so only do it if you have to!

There are many, many different options for task management available, but two well known examples are Trello and Todoist: which are cloud-based and works well across Windows and Mac and Android. Both are free for low levels of usage but start charging as you need more complexity.
