# Preparing a Simple Eco-System
{% guidance "Changing how we approach email " %}
<p class="lead">Checking emails has become a complex task in itself so let's try and make email as simple as possible so it can become more manageable.</p>

- Email is about receiving information and (if necessary) responding.  
- So we really just want our inbox to contain emails we haven't yet responded to.
- We therefore need a simple Eco-System of places where we can cascade the actions or information that result from these emails so they can be dealt with most easily.  These can be either paper-based or digital places. 
- For now, we would recommend making the simplest possible changes to allow you to keep your inbox nice and tidy.  Pen and paper solutions are absolutely fine.

  <p class="lead">This allows us to return to using pen and paper if, for whatever reason, we need to.
