{% idea "Think about whether you actually need to use digital technology" %}
Digital technology can enhance an existing process because of its inherent characteristics: 

- Computers are very good are doing simple repetitive tasks at high speed: compare keeping digital accounts, where the totals are automatically recalculated, to keeping paper accounts.
- The internet is really good at allowing information to be shared widely: compare sending an email to five people to sending a letter to five people
- Digital information is often easy to search: compare  searching for an email to finding a letter in a cabinet (that may depend on how well organised your cabinet is!)
- Digital information is easy to change: compare keeping a digital journal of your day, where you can move content around and add in sections, to keeping a paper journal, where you need to get the order right from the start.
- Sometimes using a digital tool or technology brings clear benefits - just be conscious about what they are, and question your decision if they aren't obvious.
