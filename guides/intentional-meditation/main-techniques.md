<h1>Main Techniques</h1>
<p class="lead">There are two main types of meditation technique in most Buddhist traditions.  Here I am going to call them <a href="/resources/meditation/focused-awareness/">Focused Awareness</a> and <a href="/resources/meditation/close-observation">Close Observation</a> (traditionally they are known as <i>Shamatha</i> and <i>Vispassna</i> respectively).</p>

<p>It is important to understand from the start that Buddhism is a diverse collection of different traditions, with very different perspectives, and to be clear about the intentions behind the techniques, so you can see if the perspectives and intentions match with your own.</p>

<p>In most Buddhist traditions, the <a href="/resources/meditation/focused-awareness/">Focused Awareness</a>  and <a href="/resources/meditation/close-observation">Close Observation</a> techniques are used in combination.  Usually, <a href="/resources/meditation/focused-awareness/">Focused Awareness</a> is seen as a preparation for <a href="/resources/meditation/close-observation">Close Observation</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a technique, associated primarily with later Buddhist traditions, that I will call <a href="/meditation/open-awareness">Open Awareness</a>, in which you have a broad and open focus on your surroundings.</p>

<p>Either <a href="/resources/meditation/focused-awareness/">Focused Awareness</a> or <a href="/resources/meditation/open-awareness">Open Awareness</a> may be good starting points - depending on your intentions.</p>
