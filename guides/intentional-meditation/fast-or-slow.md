<h1>Slow or Fast Approaches</h1>

<p class="lead">There are broadly two types of approach to meditation in Buddhist traditions: the Slow and Fast approaches.</p>

<h2>The Slow Approach</h2>

<p>The assumption behind the slow approach is that getting an profound insight into what reality is like is very hard and you need to spend a long time (in traditional Buddhism many life-times) steadily working at it.</p>

<table class="table table-success table-striped m-4">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Pros</th>
        <th>Cons</th>
    </tr>
        </thead>
    <tbody class="table-group-divider">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>This approach may suit you better if you like gradually learning something and don't like sudden surprises</li>
                <li>Getting a profound insight into what reality is like and then being able to use that insight skilfully is hard - it may be best to be realistic about this from the start</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>It may be a slow and painful journey - you may lose track of what you are trying to do</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
        </tbody>
</table>

<h2>The Fast Approach</h2>

<p>The assumption behind the fast approach is that you actually already have a profound insight into what reality is like but you have just forgotten it or it has been obscured.  The process is therefore a kind of remembering or removing of the things that have got in the way.</p>

<table class="table table-success table-striped m-4">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Pros</th>
        <th>Cons</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody class="table-group-divider">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>If you can cope with sudden surprises, you may make fast initial progress</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>While there <i>may</i> be an initial quick breakthrough, the integration of that breakthrough into every day life may require some of the careful, gradual Slow Approach</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
        </tbody>
</table>
